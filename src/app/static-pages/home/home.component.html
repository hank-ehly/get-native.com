                    Get native is all about breaking the barrier between fluid speech and native like speech. Our way
                    of breaking the barrier is through intensive observation, pronunciation practice and active learning
                    using video interviews of native speakers. Needless to say in order for this to work we need a lot
                    of interview videos!
                    <!--<br>
                    The get native video database currently contains X video interviews in English and Japanese, and we
                    will continue to add more. The interviews are all related to things innately interesting to language
                    learners and those interested in other cultures. Have an idea for an interesting subcategory? We'd love to
                    hear what you think.-->

                    Wouldn't it be awesome to have an intense language study session in 15 minutes, or even 10? If
                    you're an Advanced learner of the language you may already have your own study routine. But that
                    study routine might include getting out books, scrolling through web pages -- it could take up to 10
                    minutes just to get all the materials ready!
                    <!--<br>
                    Get native offers study sessions, which are kind of like an app inside an app. Once you find a
                    video that you'd like to study, specify the amount of time that you'd like to study and Get Native
                    will guide you through a study routine designed to help you improve your pronunciation in fluidity
                    in the target language.-->

                    Get Native is most useful to language learners who already have a good command of the target
                    language, yet want to make the speech sound more like that of a native speaker. Finding good study
                    material is easy when you've just set out learning the target language. But as you advance, every
                    day material like newspapers, journal articles, TV, podcasts and conversations with other speakers
                    might become the core of your study routine.
                    <!--<br>
                    As a language learner myself, I often wished they were more language learning materials focused on
                    native like pronunciation and vocabulary use. Get native gives you the tools that you need to sound
                    more native-like and use more natural phrases and collocations.-->
