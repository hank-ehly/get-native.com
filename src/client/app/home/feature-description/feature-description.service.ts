                    of breaking the barrier is through intensive observation, pronunciation practice and active learning 
                    using video interviews of native speakers. Needless to say in order for this to work we need a lot 
                    of interview videos!`,

                    will continue to add more. The interviews are all related to things innately interesting to language 
                    learners and those interested in other cultures. Have an idea for an interesting topic? We'd love to 
                    hear what you think.`

                    you're an Advanced learner of the language you may already have your own study routine. But that 
                    study routine might include getting out books, scrolling through web pages -- it could take up to 10
                    minutes just to get all the materials ready!`,

                    will guide you through a study routine designed to help you improve your pronunciation in fluidity

                    language, yet want to make the speech sound more like that of a native speaker. Finding good study 
                    material is easy when you've just set out learning the target language. But as you advance, every 
                    day material like newspapers, journal articles, TV, podcasts and conversations with other speakers
                    might become the core of your study routine.`,

                    native like pronunciation and vocabulary use. Get native gives you the tools that you need to sound 
                    more native-like and use more natural phrases and collocations.`],
