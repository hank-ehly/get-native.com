### Browse / Search Videos
The focus of Get Native is on studying video interviews. Users can browse and/or filter-search video interviews based on preset criteria. Videos are stored on the origin server and sent to the client using HTTP Range Requests [RFC 7233] via the HTML5 `<video>` interface. Videos are proprietary and are not available for download; however, they are free to view online.

### Study Sessions
A Get Native Study Session is a timed exercise performed while logged into the app. The user selects a video, specifies the amount of time (in minutes) they want to study, and is led through a series of 4 language exercises utilizing the chosen video:

* Listening
* Shadowing
* Speaking
* Writing

### Multiple language support
Get Native provides video interviews in multiple languages, which makes it possible to study multiple languages. Users can change the current Study Language at any time by hovering over the bottom right corner of the screen when logged in.
