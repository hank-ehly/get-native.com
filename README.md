## 1. Purpose and Goal

### 1.1 General Description
Get Native is a web application (described here forth as app) for language learning. It allows users to login, browse a database of video interviews, and view or study the original and/or translated version of the script accompanying each video.

### 1.2 Goal
This app serves as a study tool for language learners who have already reached a comfortable level of proficiency but wish to make their word choice and pronunciation sound more native-like.

### 1.3 Target Audience
The target audience of this app is the advanced language learner who wishes to bring their pronunciation and word-choice of the target language closer to that of a native speaker.

## 2. Features

### 2.2 Browse / Search Videos
The focus of Get Native is on studying video interviews. Users can browse and/or filter-search video interviews based on preset criteria. Videos are stored on the origin server and sent to the client using HTTP Range Requests [RFC 7233] via the HTML5 <video> interface. Videos are proprietary and are not available for download; however, they are free to view online.

### 4.2 Operating System
Both the web server and database server will be built on the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS operating system.

### 4.3 Deployment
Continuous deployment is performed through Circle CI. 
A successful staging or production build prompts automatic deployment to Digital Ocean droplet.

### 4.4 Provisioning
A single Chef recipe is used to provision both staging and production environments.
